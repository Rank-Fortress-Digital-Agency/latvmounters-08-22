            How to choose the right TV mount for your needs
          </h2>
          <p>
            When it comes to choosing a TV mount, there are a few things you’ll need to take into consideration. First, you’ll need to decide what type of mount you want. There are three basic types of mounts: fixed, tilting, and full-motion. A fixed mount is the most basic option, and as the name suggests, it doesn’t allow for any movement once it’s installed. A tilting mount allows you to tilt the TV up or down, while a full-motion mount gives you the most flexibility, allowing you to swivel, tilt, and even extend the TV away from the wall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you’ve decided on the type of mount you want, you’ll need to choose the right size. Most mounts are designed for specific TV sizes, so it’s important to make sure you get a mount that’s compatible with your TV.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, you’ll need to decide where you want to install the mount. The most common place is on the wall above your fireplace, but there are other options as well.
